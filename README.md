# Life-expectancy-prediction-using-ML
A web application to predict life expectancy was built using Node-RED and connected to ML model.
The project is about developing and deploying a machine learning model which will predict the average life expectancy of various countries by providing the various factors affecting it. It will be integrated with Node-RED to create a web application which will display the average life expectancy of a country when the factors affecting it are provided as input to the application.
